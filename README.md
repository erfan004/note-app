hi this is a note app which created by react and typescript 

if you want to know how you should work with this app you can use this readme .
after cloning repo you need to go to the direction of the app and open terminal then type npm i . you only need to do this for first time.
after that you should start the json server and you can do that easily by typing npm start 
and at the end to start working with project you can use npm run dev command and that would be it . <3
